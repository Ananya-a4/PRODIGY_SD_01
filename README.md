## Temperature Converter Program

This repository contains a simple Java program that converts a given temperature value between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

## Description

The program prompts the user to enter a temperature value and specify the original unit of measurement (C, F, or K). It then converts the given temperature to all three units and displays the results.

## How It Works

The program reads the temperature value and the original unit from the user.

Based on the original unit, the temperature is converted to Celsius.

The program then converts the Celsius value to Fahrenheit and Kelvin.

Finally, all three temperature values are printed to the console.
